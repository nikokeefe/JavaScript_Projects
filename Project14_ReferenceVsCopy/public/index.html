    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team);
    
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array           copy. They both point to the same array!
    
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();

    console.log(players, team2);

    team3[3] = "Pillow"; 
    console.log(players, team3);

    // another way
    const team4 = Array.from(players);
    team4[3] = "Killow";
    console.log(players, team4);
    
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team5 = [...players];
    team5[3] = "Zillow";

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    //const captain = person;
    //captain.number = 99;
    //console.log(person, captain);
    
    // both objects have changed ðŸ™„
    
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99})
    console.log(person, captain2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //const captain3 = {...person}; - NOT YET

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
